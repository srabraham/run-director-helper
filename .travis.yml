# Anything in before_script that returns a nonzero exit code will flunk the
# build and immediately stop. It's sorta like having set -e enabled in bash.
# Make sure golangci-lint is vendored.
before_script:
  - go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint

# script always runs to completion (set +e). If we have linter issues AND a
# failing test, we want to see both. Configure golangci-lint with a
# .golangci.yml file at the top level of your repo.
script:
  - golangci-lint run       # run a bunch of code checkers/linters in parallel
  - go test -v -race ./...  # Run all the tests with the race detector enabled
